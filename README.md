Hello world script

- PrimaryActorTick.bCanEverTick = false; // defaulted to true, but since it's a one time print, set to false
- Added logging message according to a tutorial on youtube!


Update 7/1/25
- Learned how to hook debugger into project: make new C++ actor class, do basics from above, write code, then mark breakpoint as needed. Build -> Rebuild solution, then press f5 to debug
- will have to press play in level to get scripts to trigger!
